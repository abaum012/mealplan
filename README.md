# Alex & Kelsey Meal Planner
This project is a simple recipe store and meal planner system for Kelsey and I. The main features include Recipe CRUD with dynamic forms, a meal planner that lists one week's worth of meals, and a grocery list generator that takes a Meal Plan and generates a mobile accessible grocery checklist.

The project is being used to check out Laravel's new docker/container environment and to catch up on the Vue 3 changes and make a Single Page Application.
